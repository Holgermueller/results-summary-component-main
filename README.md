## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

This project gave me more practice using linear gradients and the hsla() function.

### Continued development

If I ever revisit this project, I'll probably work on a way to pull the data from the JSON file, rather than hard coding it onto the DOM.
